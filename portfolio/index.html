        <h1>Super 8 Motel Television</h1>
        <p>
            Composed as a post-digital palimpsest, this chromatic field mobilizes glitch as method. Pixel-fragments
            aggregate into a rhizomatic cartography whose center blooms in sunset hues, then withdraws into zones of
            opacity. The work interrogates screen vernaculars—compression artifacts, latency, jitter—while staging their
            materiality as painterly event. Affective bandwidth oscillates between legibility and noise, producing a
            contingent image that is at once indexical and unstable. Architecture appears and unbuilds itself;
            landscapes surface as data residues. Through recursive layering and ruptures, the composition enacts an
            ethics of attention, asking the viewer to inhabit thresholds where mediation becomes subject, and perception
            rehearses its own estrangement.

        <h1>Obscure Resistance</h1>
        <p>
            This photograph stages an entropic field of standardized matter: a rhizomatic lattice of through-hole
            resistors suspended in a translucent armature. The work mobilizes the color-band taxonomy as a chromatic
            code—teal, ochre, carbon black—oscillating between legibility and noise. Refusing a single point of focus,
            the composition produces a non-hierarchical spatialization where vectors, tolerances, and failure thresholds
            cohabit. The image operates as an index of analog labor, a salvage archive of pre-digital desire, while its
            metallic glare invokes the haptic promise of circuitry never completed. By compressing utility into
            ornament, the piece performs an ethics of resistance: a poetics of signal damped into aesthetics. What
            emerges is less still life than infrastructural sublime—an ambient diagram of how objects conspire to slow
            the world down.

        <h1>Drunk London Toilet</h1>
        <p>
            Okay okay—so it's, like, a wall. A majestic beige-ish… gray? Eggshell? The camera wobbles like I do when I
            stand up too fast, kinda drifting in, drifting out, like it wants to kiss the paint. You can see little
            dings and freckles, real intimate, like drywall pores. Light slides across it—shh—very slow, like butter
            melting. Nothing happens and suddenly that's everything. I keep waiting for a door or a ghost or, I dunno, a
            clue, but nope: wall. Solid. Stoic. The shot quivers, I quiver, we're all quivering. It's dumb and holy at
            the same time. I love this wall. Walls forever.

        <h1>Radio Interference</h1>
        <p>
            A cacophony of static, a symphony of noise. This audio piece is a collage of radio interference, capturing
            the ephemeral beauty of disrupted signals. It's like eavesdropping on the universe's forgotten
            conversations, where each crackle and hiss tells a story of lost frequencies. The soundscape oscillates
            between chaos and clarity, inviting listeners to find meaning in the dissonance. It's an auditory
            exploration of how technology mediates our experience, revealing the hidden poetry in disruption. Tune in,
            turn up the volume, and let the interference wash over you.
